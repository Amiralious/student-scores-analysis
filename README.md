# Student Scores Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on students exam scores dataset.

## Dataset
Students Performance in Exams (Kaggle)

## Goal
This project aims to explore and analyze student exam scores using exploratory data analysis techniques.
The analysis focuses on score distributions, group comparisons, and relationships between subjects,
with potential future extensions toward predictive modeling.


## Key Analysis Steps

- Data loading and initial exploration

- Feature engineering (average score calculation)

- Group-based analysis by gender, parental education level, and test preparation course

- Data visualization using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots

- Correlation analysis between exam scores

- Simple linear regression to predict writing scores based on math scores


## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
